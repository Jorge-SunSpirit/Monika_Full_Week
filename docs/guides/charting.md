# Using The Chart Editor

![Key and Table Of Contents are two different things. You're still correct though. I think..](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68293280/118520877-49692a80-b6ef-11eb-95fa-f2061fa6ad39.png)

### How to Access The Chart Editor
To access the Chart Editor, simply begin a level. Once the countdown finishes, press `7` on your keyboard. The screen will wipe, and
you will end up in the Chart Editor.

## Basics
To place or delete notes, click on a square in the Charting Grid. 

To navigate the current section, use the scroll wheel or `W` and `S`.
To go to the previous or next section, press `A` or `Left Arrow` and `D` or `Right Arrow` respectively.

To change the sustain length of a note, press `Q` to shorten and `E` to lengthen the sustain trail by 1 step.

To playtest the chart, press `Enter`.
To test the chart's sync and see if the notes are aligned with the audio, press `Space`. This will play the song, and appropriately progress the strumline. When the camera is focused on Boyfriend, all notes will make a clap sound. When the camera is focused on Player 2, all notes wil make a snap sound.

## The Tabs

### Assets

![ass sets haha funny one ninjamuffin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68293280/118521235-ac5ac180-b6ef-11eb-9d59-10cdbeadb4f0.png)

The Assets tab is where you can change level data such as the background, player characters, and note skin. 
Everything here is labelled, so this tab should be easy to use.

### Note Data

![The Useless Tabâ„¢](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68293280/118521260-b67cc000-b6ef-11eb-8ad3-3be0a503ad9a.png)

This tab doesn't have much going on, but you can change the sustain length of the currently selected note here. And no, Apply Data doesn't do anything.

### Section Data

![i spend all my time here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68293280/118521302-c09ebe80-b6ef-11eb-9c71-6305416e51c7.png)

The Section Data tab contains data related to the current section, such as the length of the current section (in steps), the BPM of the section, and whether or not
the camera should point to Boyfriend. Here, you can also copy another section of the chart by clicking "Copy Last". The stepper next to that button indicates
how far back the section you want to copy from is. This stepper can go into negative values to copy sections from later in the song.

"Clear Section" and "Swap Section", respectively, clear the current section and swap the notes of Player 1 and Player 2.

Alternate Animation is used exclusively for the Mom and Dad from Week 5 in the vanilla game, but if your character has an Alternate Animation, you can tick this checkbox to use the other animation instead of the normal animation. This checkbox is applied per-section, which means you have to tick the checkmark across all the sections it is required for. Alternate Animations don't apply to the idle animation.

### Song Data

In the Song Data tab, you can change the BPM of the chart and the speed at which the arrows arrive on the screen.
You can also reset the whole chart to start over again, and reload the chart or audio in case you changed something.

"Load Autosave" attempts to roll the chart back to when you last playtested or saved it.

"Save" does what you would think it does, and allows you to save your chart to somewhere on your computer.

"Vocal Volume" and "Instrumental Volume" control the volume of their respective audios.

## Position Info

![statistics sucks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68293280/118525571-30af4380-b6f4-11eb-8a49-b7d5af6dba28.png)


In the top right of the chart editor, you can find information about your position in the chart, such as your current Section, Step, and how long the song that accompanies the track is.
