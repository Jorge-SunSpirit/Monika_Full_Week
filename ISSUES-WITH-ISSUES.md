# Addressing Various Topics Related to Issues &/Or Discussions

Read this before making an issue. It pretty much just tells you what and what not to complain about.
## Issues

### What should go in an issue?
An issue should adhere to one of the two templates, Bug Report or Enhancement. (You can also create from blank but meh)

An issue should NOT be related to any problems in forks or mods of Kade Engine.

What the individual issue templates are for is self-explanatory, but please ACTUALLY use them. Don't just leave them blank and put all or partial info in the title.


## Discussions

### What should go in a discussion?
Discussions should be related to mods or forks of Kade Engine, as well as topics related to building the game from source.

> issues are for suggestions/bugs with kade engine itself, not with forks/mods of it.
